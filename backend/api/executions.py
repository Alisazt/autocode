"""
Execution API for starting and monitoring project runs.

This module defines REST endpoints for creating new executions
within the AutoDev system. When a client requests a new execution
the orchestrator is invoked asynchronously and the execution ID
is returned immediately. Clients can then subscribe to realâ€‘time
events via the WebSocket endpoint to monitor progress.
