"""
Minimal guardrails engine for validating generated artifacts.

In the full AutoDev system this module would perform extensive
validation of AIâ€‘generated output using JSON Schema, OpenAPI
validators, and custom business rules. For the purposes of this
demo project we only provide a stub implementation that always
considers output valid. This allows the rest of the orchestrator
and execution pipeline to function without being blocked by
validation failures.
